### Installation

Before using this collection, you need to install it with the Ansible Galaxy command-line tool:

You can also include it in a `requirements.yml` file and install it with `ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml`, using the format:

```yaml
---
collections:
  - name: microsoft.scom
```

Note that if you install the collection from Ansible Galaxy, it will not be upgraded automatically when you upgrade the `ansible` package. To upgrade the collection to the latest available version, run the following command:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install microsoft.scom --upgrade
```

You can also install a specific version of the collection, for example, if you need to downgrade when something is broken in the latest version (please report an issue). Use the following syntax to install version `0.1.0`:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install microsoft.scom:==0.1.0
```

See [using Ansible collections](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/user_guide/collections_using.html) for more details.

### Using the Collection SCOM Plugin On AAP/EDA

In order to use the collection plugin `scom_plugin` on your AAP/EDA you have to have it on the EDA Decision Environment

To build an EDA Decision Environment use `microsoft.scom/Containerfile`

```bash
podman build -t scom-eda-de:1.0.0 .
```

Push the image to your container registry

Use the image to create decision environment in EDA

In EDA Rulebook Activations create rulebook activation with the created decision environment
